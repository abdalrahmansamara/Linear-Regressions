# Exploratory Analysis with Linear Regressions

Linear Regression is usually the first machine learning algorithm that every data scientist comes across. It is a simple model but everyone needs to master it as it lays the foundation for other machine learning algorithms.

## Where can Linear Regression be used?

It is a very powerful technique and can be used to understand the factors that influence profitability. It can be used to forecast sales in the coming months by analyzing the sales data for previous months. It can also be used to gain various insights about customer behavior. By the end of the blog we will build a model which looks like the below picture i.e, determine a line which best fits the data.

## Objective

The objective of a linear regression model is to find a relationship between one or more features(independent variables) and a continuous target variable(dependent variable). When there is only feature it is called Uni-variate Linear Regression and if there are multiple features, it is called Multiple Linear Regression.
